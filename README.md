## MyReads
  This project related to Advanced web track introduced by *Udacity* and *Egypt FWD*

### Project description
 * Simple web application to select and categorize books to 3 categories {Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read}
 * The app has 2 pages, a home page for displaying categorized books and a search page to search for a certain book and add it to new category
 * In both pages you can simply change the book category and it go directly to its destination dynamically without reloading
